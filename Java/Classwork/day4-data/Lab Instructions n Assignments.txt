Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete the same.

2. MUST go through "sequence.txt"  from day1-data\day1_help\ & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf

3. Go through  code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve (Hands on)
4.1 Accept 2 double values from User (using Scanner). Check data type.
. If arguments are not doubles , supply suitable error message & terminate.
If numbers are double values , print its average.
Hint : Method of Scanner to use : hasNextDouble , nextDouble 

4.2 Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.


OR 
Create java application for the following
Accept 2 numbers from user & operation to perform
1. Add 2.Subtract 3. Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
Display the result of the operation. 
Java app must continue to run till user chooses exit option.

5.

Day 2

1. MUST revise from today's sequence ("day2-data\day2_help\sequence.txt") n
refer : day2-data\code
Revise :  mem pics for Java data areas(stack,heap,method area),
Garbage collection introduction

refer : day1-data\day1_help\diagrams\different type of vars.png


2. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing1.java

4. Hands on
(Currently place all the classes in the default un named package)

Create a  class Point2D   for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords
eg : public String show() {.....}

4.3 (Optional work)
Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

How will you invoke it from the tester 
A Hint : 

eg : p1.isEqual(p2); 
OR
p2.isEqual(p1)

4.4 (Optional work)
Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

eg : In Tester :
double distance=p1.calculateDistance(p2);

4.5  Create a separate Driver(main)  class(for UI )  , "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the co-ordinates
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
4.8  (Optional work)
Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.


Day 3
Refer to today's sequence.txt

1. Use day3.1 , to revise 
access specifiers , packages n methods to pass the reference n methods returning reference.

2. Start the IDE (STS 3.9.18 : Eclipse IDE with Spring plug in)
Create a new workspace for core java.
With lab faculty's help , you can import day3.2 , in your workspace
Revise : arrays of primitive type n array of references
for-each loop
for vs for-each loop

3. Complete pending work

OPTIONAL hands on WORK

1. Modify yesterday's Point2D's assignment
Re factor (modify) n add Point2D class under the package - com.developers.geometry
Add TestPoints class under the package - com.tester
Make necessary changes .

2.1   Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

1. Prompt user , how many points to plot? 
Create suitable array. (Hint : array of references)

2. Show following options

Options : 
1. Plot a point
Inputs : array index , x  ,y
Check boundary conditions  , check if some point is already plotted at the same index , if not then store the point details.
In case of any errors , display suitable error message.

2.   Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.

0. Exit 


Day 4

We have started with extremely important topics today - inheritance , up casting (indirect referencing) n  run time polymorphism.

Please complete the revision first , as per instructions below.
If time permits , then complete the pending work.
No new assignments !!!

1. import day4.1 project in the workspace.
1.1 Refer - day4-data\code\day4.1\src\test_static\Test.java
refer to - "day4-data\day4_help\readmes\regarding static.txt"
Revise static data member , methods, init block

1.2 refer - "day4-data\code\day4.1\src\tester\Test1.java"
To revise constructor invocation , in multi level inheritance hierarchy

1.3 refer - "day4-data\code\day4.1\src\tester\Test2.java" n Person , Student , Faculty 
To revise inheritance , super keyword , method overriding 
readme - "day4-data\day4_help\readmes\readme inheritance_polymorphism.txt"


1.4 refer - "day4-data\code\day4.1\src\tester\Test3.java"  
To revise up casting , run time polymorphism

2. import day4.2 project in the workspace.
2.1 refer -"day4-data\code\day4.2\src\tester\TestToSring.java"
Revise toString of Object class , overridden by the sub classes.
(Here using Person p : as the super class reference)

2.2 refer -"day4-data\code\day4.2\src\tester\TestToSring2.java"
Revise toString of Object class , overridden by the sub classes.
(Here using Object p : as the super class reference)

2.3 Application of all of above : 
refer - "day4-data\code\day4.2\src\tester\EventOrganizerApp.java"
As you know , we have not yet tested it. So please go through it n test it thoroughly !

3. Reading H.W
Box b=new Box(1,2,3);
System.out.println(b);
Q : In abve line , why it will call b.toString() automatically ?
